      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year has been very difficult for me. Because living in another country you need time to adapt. And thanks to the fact that students from different countries study at RUDN University, I was able to quickly get used to a new place.
Since at the beginning of the year the lesson was held in a remote format, it was very difficult for me to get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
